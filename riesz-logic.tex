\section{Introduction}

We introduce Riesz Logic, a variant of fuzzy logic whose models are
abelian lattice ordered groups, of which the most familiar examples
are vector lattices, or Riesz spaces.
% Our logic has axioms very similar to those
% of fuzzy logics, in particular Basic Fuzzy Logic (BL), although the
% models are quite different.
%
% % Axioms:
% % These two together allow proof of first five BAL axioms
% P((x => y) => ((y => z) => (x => z))) # label(BL1).
% P(((y => z) => (x => z)) => (x => y)) # label(BL1a).
%
% % Needed to prove BALPI and BALPa
% P(x ^ y => x)                         # label(BL2).
%
% % Needed to prove BALO
% P(x ^ y => y ^ x)                     # label(BL3).
%
% % Monotonicity of conjunction
% P((x => y) => (z ^ x => z ^ y)).
%
Our logic has a single derivation rule, modus ponens
\begin{equation}\tag{MP}
\frac{\phi, \phi \rightarrow \psi}{\psi},
\end{equation}
the following axioms from Basic Fuzzy Logic:
\begin{align}
  \tag{BL1} &(\phi \rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow ((\psi \rightarrow \chi)
  \rightarrow (\phi \rightarrow \chi))\\
  \tag{BL2} &\phi \with \psi \rightarrow \phi\\
  \tag{BL3} &\phi \with \psi \rightarrow \psi \with \phi,
\end{align}
and the following new axioms:
\begin{align}
  \tag{R1} &((\psi \rightarrow \chi) \rightarrow (\phi \rightarrow
  \chi)) \rightarrow (\phi \rightarrow \psi)\\
  \tag{R2} &(\phi \with \chi \rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow (\phi \rightarrow \psi) \with (\chi \rightarrow \psi).
  % \tag{R2}  &(\phi \rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow (\chi \with \phi
  % \rightarrow \chi \with \psi).
\end{align}
In this paper we prove that the models for this logic are the abelian
lattice ordered groups by showing its equivalence to the Logic of
Equilibrium of \cite{Galli:04}.

%  In particular there is no ``True'' or
% ``False'' constant, instead there is a zero value which indicates
% maximal uncertainty about a proposition. We demonstrate that our logic
% is equivalent to the logic BAL of

\section{Motivation}

The motivation for our work is recent work in natural language
processing, in which the meaning of words is determined by the
contexts in which they occur. This notion of ``distributional
semantics'' has its origin in the work of Firth \cite{Firth:57} and
Harris \cite{Harris:68}, and the philosophy of Wittgenstein
\cite{Wittgenstein:53}.

\section{Interpretations}

We prove the soundness and completeness of Riesz logic with respect to
abelian lattice ordered groups.

\begin{definition}[Lattice Ordered Group]
  A partially ordered group is a tuple $\langle G, +, \le\rangle$ such
  that $\langle G, +\rangle$ is a group, and $\le$ is a partial order
  on $G$ such that if $u \le v$ then $u + w \le v + w$ and $w + u \le
  w + v$. If $\le$ is a lattice order, then $G$ is called a lattice
  ordered group. Where there is no confusion, we refer to the lattice
  ordered group $\langle G, +, \le\rangle$ as simply $G$. We denote
  the lattice meet and join by $\land$ and $\lor$ respectively.
\end{definition}

Riesz spaces are abelian lattice ordered groups where the group
operation is vector space addition, and the vector space zero is the
unit of the group.

An interpretation $\langle G, F\rangle$ for Riesz Logic
is an abelian lattice ordered group $G$ and a function $F$ that maps
variables in Riesz Logic to elements of $G$. A Riesz Logic formula $x$
has the interpretation $\interp{x}$ defined recursively as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\interp{\phi} = F(\phi)$
\item $\interp{x \rightarrow y} = \interp{y} - \interp{x}$
\item $\interp{x \with y} = \interp{x} \land \interp{y}$
\end{itemize}
The formula $x$ is interpreted as asserting that $0 \le
\interp{x}$. Thus, for example, the formula $\phi \rightarrow \psi$ is
interpreted as the assertion $0 \le F(\psi) - F(\phi)$, or $F(\phi)
\le F(\psi)$. A formula $x$ is satisfiable if there is some
interpretation such that $0 \le \interp{x}$; it is a theorem or
tautology if $0 \le \interp{x}$ for all interpretations.

\section{Soundness}

Proving soundness of the logic amounts to proving the validity of the
rule and axioms.

%\subsection{Modus Ponens}

\begin{proof}[Modus Ponens]
If $0 \le F(\phi)$ and $0 \le F(\psi) - F(\phi)$ then
$0 \le F(\psi)$ by transitivity of $\le$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[BL1 and R1]
  Since R1 is the converse of BL1, they may be taken together as
  asserting equality, by the antisymmetry of $\le$. Thus we need to
  show:
  \begin{align*}
    \interp{\phi \rightarrow \psi} & = \interp{(\psi \rightarrow
      \chi) \rightarrow (\phi \rightarrow \chi)}\\
    F(\psi) - F(\phi) & = \interp{\phi \rightarrow \chi} -
    \interp{\psi \rightarrow \chi}\\
    & = F(\chi) - F(\phi) - F(\chi) + F(\psi)\\
    & = F(\psi) - F(\phi).
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}
BL2 and BL3 are trivially seen to be properties of the partial
ordering.

\begin{proof}[R2]
\begin{align*}
  \interp{\phi \with \chi \rightarrow \psi} &\le \interp{(\phi \rightarrow \psi) \with (\chi \rightarrow \psi)}\\
  F(\psi) - F(\phi)\land F(\chi) &\le (F(\psi) - F(\phi)) \land
  (F(\psi) - F(\chi))
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
