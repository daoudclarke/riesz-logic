## Overview

 - A Logic for Vector Space Semantics
 - Abelian Logic
 - Relation to other logics



## What if vector spaces had a logic?



$$\Huge{x \lor y \qquad\qquad x \land y}$$
# <br>
$$\Huge{x \rightarrow y \qquad\qquad \neg x}$$



## Why?



## Combine logical and distributional semantics



## &ldquo;I like Fidel Castro and his beard&rdquo;



## king - man + woman = queen

(Mikolov et al)



## But vector spaces have too little structure &hellip;

## Basis $\Rightarrow$ Structure
$\Rightarrow$ Vector Lattice (Riesz Space)



$$\Huge{\widehat{\mathit{orange}}\lor \widehat{\mathit{fruit}}}$$
# <br>
$$\Huge{\widehat{\mathit{orange}}\land \widehat{\mathit{fruit}}}$$



<div class="disjunction-title">$\widehat{\mathit{orange}}$</div>
<div class="disjunction"></div>



## Is that it?



$$\Huge{{\mathit{orange}}\rightarrow {\mathit{fruit}}}$$
# <br>
$$\Huge{\neg{\mathit{orange}}}$$



## What is truth?



## Give up standard propositional calculus



## Look more like a fuzzy logic



## Accept negative values



## Assertions assert positivity



$$\large{\mathit{orange}\rightarrow \mathit{fruit}}$$
## <br>
$$\large{\widehat{\mathit{fruit}} - \widehat{\mathit{orange}}} \ge 0$$
## <br>
$$\large{\widehat{\mathit{orange}}} \le \widehat{\mathit{fruit}}$$



$$\Huge{\neg\mathit{orange}}$$
## <br>
$$\Huge{-\widehat{\mathit{orange}}}$$



<div class="disjunction-title">$\widehat{\mathit{orange}}$</div>
<div class="disjunction"></div>



## Vector lattices are abelian lattice ordered groups

$\Rightarrow$ Abelian Logic (Meyer and Slaney)



## Abelian lattice ordered group

 - Abelian group: $\ \ \quad x - x = 0$
 - Lattice ordered: $\quad x \land y + z = (x + z) \land (y + z)$ 



## Abelian Logic (from A to Z)

## Axioms (Part I)

<div style='zoom:1;'>
\begin{align}
&\textrm{identity} && (\phi \rightarrow \phi) \\\\
&\textrm{weak permutation} && (\phi \rightarrow ((\psi \rightarrow \chi) \rightarrow \delta)) \rightarrow ((\psi \rightarrow \chi) \rightarrow (\phi \rightarrow \delta)) \\\\
&\textrm{suffixing} && (\phi \rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow ((\psi \rightarrow \chi) \rightarrow (\phi \rightarrow \chi)) \\\\
&\textrm{contraposition} && (\phi \rightarrow \lnot \psi) \rightarrow (\psi \rightarrow \lnot \phi)\\\\
&\textrm{double negation} && \lnot\lnot \phi \rightarrow \phi\\\\
&\textrm{assertion} && \phi \rightarrow ((\phi \rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow \psi)\\\\
&\textrm{relativization} && ((\phi \rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow \phi\\\\
\end{align}
</div>
<!-- &\textrm{unit} && 1\\\\ -->
<!-- &\textrm{unit implication} && 1 \rightarrow (\phi \rightarrow \phi)\\\\ -->



## Axioms (Part II)

<div style='zoom:1;'>
\begin{align}
&\land\rightarrow && (\phi \land \psi) \rightarrow \phi \\\\
&\land\rightarrow && (\phi \land \psi) \rightarrow \psi \\\\
&\rightarrow\land && ((\phi \rightarrow \psi) \land (\phi \rightarrow \chi)) \rightarrow (\phi \rightarrow (\psi \land \chi))\\\\
&\rightarrow\lor && \phi \rightarrow (\phi \lor \psi) \\\\
&\rightarrow\lor && \psi \rightarrow (\phi \lor \psi) \\\\
&\lor\rightarrow && ((\phi \rightarrow \chi) \land (\psi \rightarrow \chi)) \rightarrow ((\phi \lor \psi) \rightarrow \chi)\\\\
&\textrm{distributivity} && (\phi \land (\psi \lor \chi)) \rightarrow ((\phi \land \psi) \lor (\phi \land \chi))\\\\
\end{align}
</div>



## Rules
###<br>
$$\huge{\frac{\phi,\ \phi \rightarrow \psi}{\psi}} \quad\quad \huge{\frac{\phi,\ \psi}{\phi \land \psi}}$$



## Abelian Logic is sound and complete w.r.t. abelian lattice ordered groups



## Relevance logics: reject
 
$\phi \rightarrow (\psi \rightarrow \phi)$

 - If 2 + 2 = 4, then the fact the Moon is made of Camembert implies that 2 + 2 = 4.
 - But 2 + 2 = 4. Therefore, by modus ponens, the fact that the Moon
   is made of Camembert implies that 2 + 2 = 4

\begin{align}
T(a, b) &= T(b, a) \\\\
T(a, b) &\le T(c, d) \text{ if } a \le c  \text{ and } b \le d\\\\
T(a, T(b, c)) &= T(T(a, b), c)\\\\

# Conclusion



## Vector spaces in CL have a logic



## Future work: higher order logic
