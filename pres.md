## Overview

 - A Logic for Vector Space Semantics
 - Relation to Fuzzy logic



## What if vector spaces had a logic?



$$\Huge{x \lor y \qquad\qquad x \land y}$$
# <br>
$$\Huge{x \rightarrow y \qquad\qquad \neg x}$$



## Why?



## Combine logical and distributional semantics



## &ldquo;I like Fidel Castro and his beard&rdquo;



## king - man + woman = queen

(Mikolov et al)



## But vector spaces have too little structure &hellip;

## Basis $\Rightarrow$ Structure
$\Rightarrow$ Vector Lattice (Riesz Space)



$$\Huge{\widehat{\mathit{orange}}\lor \widehat{\mathit{fruit}}}$$
# <br>
$$\Huge{\widehat{\mathit{orange}}\land \widehat{\mathit{fruit}}}$$



<div class="disjunction-title">$\widehat{\mathit{orange}}$</div>
<div class="disjunction"></div>



## Is that it?



$$\Huge{{\mathit{orange}}\rightarrow {\mathit{fruit}}}$$
# <br>
$$\Huge{\neg{\mathit{orange}}}$$



## What is truth?



## Give up standard propositional calculus



## Look more like a fuzzy logic



## Accept negative values



## Assertions assert positivity



$$\large{\mathit{orange}\rightarrow \mathit{fruit}}$$
## <br>
$$\large{\widehat{\mathit{fruit}} - \widehat{\mathit{orange}}} \ge 0$$
## <br>
$$\large{\widehat{\mathit{orange}}} \le \widehat{\mathit{fruit}}$$



$$\Huge{\neg\mathit{orange}}$$
## <br>
$$\Huge{-\widehat{\mathit{orange}}}$$



<div class="disjunction-title">$\widehat{\mathit{orange}}$</div>
<div class="disjunction"></div>



## Vector lattices are abelian lattice ordered groups

$\Rightarrow$ Abelian Logic (Meyer and Slaney)

## $\mathrm{FL}_{eo}$ algebras:
$0 \le x$



## Fuzzy logic semantics:

$$\huge{[0,1]}$$

## T-norm



\begin{align}
T(a, b) &= T(b, a) \\\\
T(a, b) &\le T(c, d) \text{ if } a \le c  \text{ and } b \le d\\\\
T(a, T(b, c)) &= T(T(a, b), c)\\\\
T(a, 1) &= a
\end{align}



## ≈Åukasiewicz T-norm
## <br>
$$\huge{T_L(a,b) = \max\\{0, a + b - 1\\}}$$

## Riesz T-norm?



## Logistic addition



$$\huge{T_R(a, b) = \frac{ab}{ab + (1-a)(1-b)}}$$



<!-- $$\huge{\neg x := 1 - x}$$ -->
<!-- $$T(a,b) := a \oplus b$$ -->
<embed src="vector-add.svg"/>



\begin{align}
T(a, b) &= T(b, a) \\\\
T(a, b) &\le T(c, d) \text{ if } a \le c  \text{ and } b \le d\\\\
T(a, T(b, c)) &= T(T(a, b), c)\\\\
\color{red}{T(a, 1)} &\color{red}{= a}
\end{align}



# Conclusion



## Vector spaces in CL have a logic



## Future work: higher order logic
